### NoSQL Databases

**Definition**  
- NoSQL = “Not Only SQL” (not “No SQL”).  
- Non-relational design with **flexible schemas**.  
- Stores structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  
- Often schema-less, does not always use SQL (some support SQL-like queries).  
- Built for scale, performance, and ease of use in modern web/mobile apps.  

**Types of NoSQL Databases**  
1. **Key-Value Stores**  
   - Data stored as key-value pairs.  
   - Use cases: user sessions, preferences, caching, recommendations.  
   - Examples: Redis, Memcached, DynamoDB.  
   - Limitation: poor fit for complex queries or relationships.  

2. **Document Databases**  
   - Store data as JSON-like documents.  
   - Flexible indexing, powerful ad hoc queries.  
   - Use cases: eCommerce, CRM, medical records, analytics.  
   - Examples: MongoDB, DocumentDB, CouchDB, Cloudant.  
   - Limitation: not great for complex multi-operation transactions.  

3. **Column-Based Databases**  
   - Data stored by columns (column families).  
   - Optimized for fast writes and searches.  
   - Use cases: time-series, IoT, weather data, heavy write systems.  
   - Examples: Cassandra, HBase.  
   - Limitation: poor for changing query patterns or complex queries.  

4. **Graph Databases**  
   - Represent data as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).  
   - Excellent for connected data and relationship analysis.  
   - Use cases: social networks, fraud detection, recommendations, network diagrams.  
   - Examples: Neo4J, CosmosDB.  
   - Limitation: not optimized for high-volume transaction processing.  

**Advantages of NoSQL**  
- Handles massive volumes of diverse data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).  
- Distributed systems scale across data centers/cloud.  
- Cost-effective scale-out with commodity hardware.  
- Simpler design, flexible, highly scalable.  

**RDBMS vs. NoSQL (Key Differences)**  
- **Schema**: RDBMS = rigid schemas; NoSQL = flexible/agnostic.  
- **Cost**: RDBMS = expensive commercial systems; NoSQL = designed for low-cost scale-out.  
- **ACID**: RDBMS supports ACID transactions; NoSQL often prioritizes scalability and availability over strict ACID.  
- **Maturity**: RDBMS = mature, predictable; NoSQL = newer but rapidly growing.  

**Summary**  
NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and performance for modern applications, complementing (not replacing) traditional relational databases.
