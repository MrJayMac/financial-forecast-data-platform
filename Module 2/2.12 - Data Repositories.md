### Data Repositories: Warehouses, Marts, and Lakes

**Goal**  
All serve as repositories to store data for reporting, analysis, and insights, but they differ in purpose, data types, and access methods.

---

#### Data Warehouse
- **Definition:** Central repository integrating data from multiple sources; single source of truth.  
- **Data:** Current + historical, cleansed, modeled, structured, analysis-ready.  
- **Architecture:**  
  - Bottom tier: Database servers (relational, NoSQL, or both).  
  - Middle tier: OLAP server for processing/analysis.  
  - Top tier: Client tools for querying/reporting.  
- **Deployment:** On-premise or cloud (cloud = lower cost, scalable, disaster recovery).  
- **Use Cases:** Enterprise-wide reporting, BI, large-scale analytics.  
- **Examples:** Teradata, Oracle Exadata, IBM Db2 Warehouse on Cloud, Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake.

---

#### Data Mart
- **Definition:** Subset of a data warehouse, built for a specific function or user group.  
- **Types:**  
  - Dependent: Pulls data from enterprise warehouse.  
  - Independent: Built from operational/external sources.  
  - Hybrid: Combines both.  
- **Benefits:** Relevant data for users, faster response times, cost/time efficient, secure.  
- **Use Cases:** Departmental analytics (sales, finance, etc.).

#### Data Lake
- **Definition:** Repository storing raw structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in native format.  
- **Data:** Stored without predefined schema; transformed later per use case.  
- **Governance:** Data classified, protected, and governed (not a dumping ground).  
- **Technology:** Cloud object storage (Amazon S3), Hadoop, RDBMS, or NoSQL.  
- **Benefits:**  
  - Stores all data types (docs, logs, JSON, XML, CSV, relational).  
  - Scales from TB → PB.  
  - Saves time (no upfront schema).  
  - Enables repurposing for many future use cases.  
- **Examples:** AWS, Cloudera, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Snowflake.

### Key Differences
- **Warehouse:** Cleaned + structured, enterprise-wide, analysis-ready.  
- **Mart:** Subset, focused, faster for departments.  
- **Lake:** Raw, flexible, all data types, schema-on-read.  

**Summary:**  
- **Warehouses** = structured, enterprise reporting.  
- **Marts** = focused, departmental insights.  
- **Lakes** = raw + flexible, future-proof analytics.
