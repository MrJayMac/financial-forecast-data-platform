### Relational Databases (RDBMS)

**Definition**  
- Collection of data organized in tables (rows = records, columns = attributes).  
- Tables can be linked by common fields (e.g., Customer ID).  
- Uses **SQL** for querying.  

**Key Features**  
- Optimized for large-scale storage, retrieval, and processing.  
- Minimizes data redundancy (info stored once, referenced elsewhere).  
- Enforces consistency and integrity with defined data types and values.  
- Security architecture controls access and enforces policies.  
- Supports millions of records with fast query performance.  

**Examples**  
- On-premise: IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.  
- Cloud (DBaaS): Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, IBM DB2 on Cloud, Oracle Cloud, SQL Azure.  

**Advantages**  
- Flexibility: add/modify tables & columns while running.  
- Reduced redundancy.  
- Easy backup & disaster recovery (exports, mirroring, quick restore).  
- **ACID compliance** → reliable, consistent transactions.  

**Use Cases**  
- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):** fast, frequent updates and queries.  
- **Data Warehousing / OLAP:** analyze historical data for BI.  
- **IoT solutions:** lightweight, fast data collection and processing.  

**Limitations**  
- Not suited for semi-structured/unstructured data.  
- Migration requires identical schemas/data types.  
- Field length limits.  

**Summary**  
Relational databases remain the dominant technology for **structured data** despite big data, IoT, and social media trends.
