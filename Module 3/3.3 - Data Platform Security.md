### Data Platform Security – Key Points

**CIA Triad (core to all security):**  
- **Confidentiality** – prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity** – ensure data/resources are accurate and untampered.  
- **Availability** – ensure authorized users have timely access.  

**Four Facets of Security:**  
1. **Physical Infrastructure Security**  
   - Secure facilities (surveillance, access control, backup power, cooling, disaster-proof locations).  
   - Example: Cloud provider data centers.  

2. **Network Security**  
   - Firewalls, network access control, segmentation (VLANs), secure protocols (HTTPS/SSL/TLS).  
   - Intrusion detection & prevention systems.  

3. **Application Security**  
   - Secure design and coding practices.  
   - Threat modeling, risk mitigation, vulnerability testing before deployment.  

4. **Data Security**  
   - **At Rest:** Encrypt databases, files, backups, devices.  
   - **In Transit:** Encrypt traffic (HTTPS, SSL, TLS).  
   - Authentication (passwords, tokens, biometrics) + Authorization (role-based access).  

**Other Key Points:**  
- Must **monitor, audit, and react** to violations with end-to-end visibility.  
- Security requires alignment of **people, policy, processes, systems, and tools**.
